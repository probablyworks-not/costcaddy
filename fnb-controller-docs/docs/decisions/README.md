# Architecture Decision Records

One file per significant decision, numbered `NNNN-title.md`. Each ADR: **Context · Options considered ·
Decision · Consequences** (including trade-offs accepted). Add a row here when you file one.

The full consolidated decision register (D1–D14) lives in the **Architecture & Execution Plan** and is
summarised in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`. ADRs here capture the most load-bearing choices in standalone form
and are where *new* decisions get recorded going forward.
